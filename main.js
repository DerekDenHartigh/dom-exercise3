Create a circle that follows the mouse around the page. 
Whenever the mouse moves, the circle  immediately jumps to the new location.    
Hint: The event parameter to the event handler provides information on the location of the  
mouse.    

Extended Challenges:  
● Create a trail behind the mouse as it moves.  
● Instead of the circle immediately jumping to the new mouse location, have it slowly  
make progress toward the cursor.
